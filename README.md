# ML-HCI-Design-Prototype
The idea for Makers Link and prototype developed during a Human Computer Interaction course in summer 2023. The project incorporated UX/UI research, problem definition, creation of archtypes, user flows, and following User Design best practices, such as a focus on intuitive use and error tolerance.
